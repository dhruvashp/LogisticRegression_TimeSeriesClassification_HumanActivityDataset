The previous optimal file contained details corresponding to one particular
run of the file

Running again will give slightly different results as each time
the CV folds are selected at random and thus minor changes in 
train fit and test error estimation are expected

Thus every time one runs the file optimal pairs will change

Another optimal pair that was obtained was at :

l = 1 (no split)

p = 2 (constant beta 0 also included)

error = 0.05

Thus in general

l = 1 to 3 splits
with 2-3 predictors
and error of about 0.05-0.07 
seems to be a consensus result
