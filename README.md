# LogisticRegression_TimeSeriesClassification_HumanActivityDataset

The current set of codes performs Logistic Regression with a huge range of variants on the Time Series Classification Problem from the Dataset of Activity Recognition System based on Multisensor Data Fusion

This task was done as a part of an assignment for the Fall 2020 USC Course DSCI 552 taken under Prof. Rajati

Coding was done around Fall 2020, but since the original submission was in a private repository meant for the course, I re-organized the files and submitted it again in a Public Repository around Spring 2021
