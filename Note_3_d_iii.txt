Note :

We haven't used stratified cross validation, as I didn't see major
issues of class balance in this dataset

Using it would be rather simple, and would just require us to change
Kfold to StratifiedKfold using scikit learn library

Again,
Only simple Kfold has been used here, not Stratified Kfold

(Prediction errors on the test set, that is the validation set,
for Kfold were not more than 5-10 %)

(Thus as the prediction errors were bound, and were not much, I have
assumed that the problem of class imbalance here was minor, if at all
any, and thus we could use simple Kfold against the stratified version)
