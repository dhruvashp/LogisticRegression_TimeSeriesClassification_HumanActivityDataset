Total plots in d_i = 9*9
Total plots in d_ii = 18*18

A few conclusions :

There were an enormous amount of plots, and thus the comparison could be made manually only to a certain extent. However
in my comparisons, I found that

1. For features that were split, say, avg_rss12_mean_1 and avg_rss12_mean_2, the scatter plots were almost nearly
linear. Thus all those columns, that were split, then from them features were extracted, the corresponding features
in the corresponding split columns had a linear nature of the scatter plot. Thus with everything same and the only
difference being _1 and _2 for d_ii, we had a linear scatter plot.

avg_rss12_mean_1 vs avg_rss12_mean_2     in d_ii had linear plot

2. Scatter plots of, say, 

avg_rss12_mean vs var_rss23_std          in d_i

AND

avg_rss12_mean_1 vs var_rss23_std_1      in d_ii
avg_rss12_mean_2 vs var_rss23_std_2      in d_ii
avg_rss12_mean_1 vs var_rss23_std_2      in d_ii
avg_rss12_mean_2 vs var_rss23_std_1      in d_ii

Had similar natures and approximately similar curves


Thus a curve in d_i would be similar to a curve in d_ii in so far as feature (mean,std,min,max,etc.) and
time series matched with each other. Splitting didn't make much difference in the generic curve natures



THUS, Final Conclusions :

1. In d_ii same time series, same feature, split portions                                     -----------------        Approximately Linear Curve
2. Comparing d_i and d_ii, curves versus corresponding time series and corresponding features -----------------        Similar Nature Irrespective of Split (_1/_2 Header)

Additionally all histograms in d_i and d_ii were similar, irrespective of split, for corresponding time series and corresponding feature

i.e. avg_rss12_mean vs avg_rss12_mean in d_i  ------ SIMILAR TO ------ avg_rss12_mean_1 vs avg_rss12_mean_1 in d_ii -------- SIMILAR TO----- avg_rss12_mean_2 vs avg_rss12_mean_2 in d_ii


Thus quite a few similarities between the d_i and d_ii scatterplots. Thus to reduce the number of predictors one could prefer the non-split version of the 
original dataset
