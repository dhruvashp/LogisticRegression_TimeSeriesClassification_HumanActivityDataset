    "Having obtained the confidence range standard deviations for each of the 42 features over\n",
    "our entire dataset, we can say the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Over different instances, belonging to different classes, if the variation in a feature\n",
    "is not a lot, then that feature won't be able to carefully discriminate between different\n",
    "classes on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus over the same class, a feature that varies low is preferred, but over different classes\n",
    "we need features that vary, so that we can distinguish between different classes using those\n",
    "features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our standard deviation calculation was over all classes, for each feature, and thus if one wants\n",
    "to select features based on this standard deviation calculation, it would be most fruitful\n",
    "to select features that have some standard deviation. If the standard deviation is low\n",
    "over all classes of a feature it implies that over the entire class range that feature doesn't\n",
    "vary too much and thus doesn't have the characteristics of class distinguishability. Thus\n",
    "we'll select features that have standard deviations which are noticeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "The option given in the HW3 PDF is max, min and mean and observing these values over all features\n",
    "(3*6 = 18), we see that they do have a decent enough standard deviation and thus can\n",
    "distinguish well between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once could go with any other alternate approach that makes sure that the features selected \n",
    "have a decent enough standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviations can't be compared for different features with different means that well, as\n",
    "0.01 and 0.05 are just as distinguishable as 1 and 5, but 1 and 5 has a higher standard deviation\n",
    "than 0.01 and 0.05. So we have to gauge a 'large value of standard deviation' as 'large', by comparing\n",
    "the value of the standard deviation of a feature against its mean. The farther it is from its mean,\n",
    "more we have a distinguishing factor for the system. Scales don't affect this discussion much\n",
    "unless our algorithm is run on a system that has major rounding up issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we need to gauge standard deviations versus their mean, higher deviations compared to \n",
    "their means give us better features in terms of distinguishability. Again while a good 'generic metric',\n",
    "it may not always be possible for us to gauge feature distinctness in different classes just\n",
    "by looking at the standard deviations and means, but it is a usable metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than standard deviation, glancing through our data, we can select those features that\n",
    "have a tendency of changing over different classes. This is obviously possible here as our\n",
    "data set only has 88 rows. There are a few alternatives to selecting our features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could go with min, max, q1\n",
